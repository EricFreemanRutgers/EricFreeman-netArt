  <p>This work explores the idea of disappearance, memory, and historical erasure, specifically in the wake of 9/11. 
  The project encompasses multimedia installations, including digital archives, visual art, and participatory elements. It 
  invites viewers to engage with the concept of disappearance, not only as a physical absence but also as a societal and cultural phenomenon

  Wolfgang Staehle set up cameras giving a webcast of 3 popular sites, the television tower in Berlin, The Coburg Benedictine 
  monastery near Stuttgart, and a panorama of the lower Manhattan skyline. This web cast was giving live image to a gallery in New York, and it unintentionally caught the attack of 9/11 on camera.

  Velvet Strike is a mod of Counter Strike Go,  a first person shooter video game. This mod was created after 9/11, it gave players “protest sprays” to an already existing graffiti function. These protest sprays spreaded anti war messages. This mod questioned militaristic ideologies present in popular video games.
