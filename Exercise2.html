<h1>Commemoration of 9/11 in the Virtual World title 
</h1> 
  This work explores the idea of disappearance, memory, and historical erasure, specifically in the wake of 9/11. 
  The project encompasses multimedia installations, including digital archives, visual art, and participatory elements. It 
  invites viewers to engage with the concept of disappearance, not only as a physical absence but also as a societal and cultural phenomenon
